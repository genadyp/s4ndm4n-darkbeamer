# s4ndm4n-darkbeamer
Dark Theme for LaTeX beamer.

### Features
Looking at the example slides below, apparently a background picture is used. 
It can be configured within the .sty file to meet your preference 
or you comment out the line to simply use a black background. 
Beside the title page – being very plain and using the standard metadata 
such as title, subtitle, author, institute and date – the frames have a footline, 
which is divided into three parts. 
The left part contains the author's name. 
The middle part contains the presentation's title. 
The right part shows the date as well as the current and total page numbers. 
For author, title and date, you can provide additional short forms in square brackets, 
in case you run into space problems. Actual content is organized in exampleblocks, 
which you can fill with your text, figures or lists. 
Tints are aligned to one accent color, which is also a subject to configuration in the .sty file. 
ind a nice light blue in the comments or try out your own accent color.
